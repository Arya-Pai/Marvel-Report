### **Task 3: Working With Github**
---

- Git: It is a version control system which tracks the changes in a project when it is worked by a team. It helps in make changes in the project or revert to the earlier version whenever needed. It also acts as a history record and give information on the changes made in it with date,time and the developer who did it .
- GitHub: it hosts the git repositories.  
- In this task we learned to fork a repository, then make changes to it , push it to the repo and ask for a pull request.In an overall we learned all the basic commands which a developer needs to know about git and Github.

### **Task 4: Get familiar with the command line on ubuntu and do the following subtasks**
---
Ubuntu is a Linux-based OS best suited for general computing and having user-freindly interface. 

In this task, we had to : 

1. Create a folder named test.
2. cd into that folder.
3. Create a blank file without using any text editor.
4. list the files in that folder
5. create 2600 folders in this folder where each folder is named like . For example, M90 or B56
6. concatenate two text files containing any random text and display them on the terminal. 

**What did we Learn:** 

1. Basic command lines of Ubuntu like cd,ls,mkdir ,cat, touch and other commands.These are the websites I referred:
[ubuntu](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview) and [linuxhint](https://linuxhint.com/basic-25-ubuntu-commands/)
2. Learnt basic shell scripting of *loops*.

### **Task 5: Kaggle Contest**
---

Kaggle is a data-science competition platform and community for data scientists and machine learning practitioners. 
So in this the first basic contest given to any user is the Titanic ML competition through which the user csn learn how the platform works. 
The data to be fed is given by the platform itself, we have to just type in the python code to access those files and give the output. In this competition we had to build a predictive model which determine the survival rate of the passenger who drowned from thr titanic ship using the given passenger data. 

The source code can be referred through this link: [Titanic ML Notebook](https://www.example.com)

### **Task 8: Writing Resource Article using Markdown**
---
Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text using plain text editor. In this task we had to write about any article of our choice using markdown language. For this task I wrote an article on BharatGPT which was very unpopular among people.  
What is the use ? 
- Familarise with markup as it getting popular
- Learn to represent your idea in the form of an article by doing more research on it.
- Learn markup tags.
- Learn to do more of open learning.

### **Task 9: Tinkercad**
--- 

Tinkercad is an online 3D modelling program  used for designing electronic circuits and coding.  
In this task we familiarised with the use tinkercad and its applications by an example circuit in which we had estimate the distance between an obstance and sensor and display the same on the screen.The resource article was given to us: [Resource Article](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/distance-measurement-using-ultrasonic-sensor-and-arduino/)  

We did some changes in the code and also found the distance in inches and millimeter while the article had the code to display only in centimeter.


---
### **Task 10: Speed Control of DC Motor**
---
This task requires had to be done both through online simulation and also through constructing the circuit physically. The online simulation was done using Tinkercad while the offline working was done in the presence of the cordinator. We learnt how to moderate the speed of the motor using the Arduino-based setup. 
The components used were:
1. Arduino Uno R3 board
2. L298N motor driver
3. DC motor
4. Jumper wires


---
### **Task 11: LED Toggle Using ESP32**
---
ESP32 is a series of low-cost,low-power system on a chip microcontrollers with integrated Wi-Fi and dual-mode Bluetooth.We created a web-server which would help us toggle the LED connected with ESP32. The code was uploaded to the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE 

---
### **Task 12: Soldering Prerequisites**
---
Soldering is a process used or joining metal parts using a filler metal called solder.In this task we learnt about flux ,electronic copper board and soldering iron. In the presence of the cordinator I soldered a small LED to the electronic board which was later connected to a battery to check its working. We also learnt how to remove the solder.

---
### **Task 13: 555 Astable Multivibrator**
---
Astable Multivibrator is a device which produces continous pulse.It can be varied the two connected resistors R1 and R2.We use relation (R1+R2)/(R1+2R2) to know the duty cycle. From this relation, to get 60% effeciency R1=2R~2~
